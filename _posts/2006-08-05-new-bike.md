Today saw my change from 26″ to 20″ biking --- with a purchase of an [Onza T-Mag Spec 2](http://onza.com/bikes/mod/tmag_rhs_1600x1200.jpg) from [Aire Valley Cycles](http://airevalleycycles.com). Managed to scuff the frame a little within the first two hours, so maybe an [Armourdillo](http://airevalleycycles.com/smsimg/69/1388downtube1.jpg) is required. Also bought some nice shin pads, but it was too hot to wear them, so when my foot (inevitably) slipped off the pedal, I got a few more marks on my shin!

Now where're those competitions?
