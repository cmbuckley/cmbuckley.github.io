Today saw my change from a 26″ to a 20″ bike --- with a purchase of an [Onza T-Mag Spec 2](https://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg23/toby_onza/tmagspec2.jpg) from Aire Valley Cycles. Managed to scuff the frame a little within the first two hours, so maybe an [Armourdillo](https://www.trials-forum.co.uk/topic/191728-armourdillo-downtube-frame-protector-never-used/) is required. Also bought some nice shin pads, but it was too hot to wear them, so when my foot (inevitably) slipped off the pedal, I got a few more marks on my shin!

Now where're those competitions?
