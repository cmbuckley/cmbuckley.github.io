I'm still tired even a whole day after getting back, but I though it was worth it to mention how good the festival was, yet again!

I didn't get a ticket immediately after [last year](http://blog.cmbuckley.co.uk/2007/08/27/leeds-festival-2007/), but [waited until March](http://blog.cmbuckley.co.uk/2008/03/31/leeds-festival-line-up/). With hindsight, I reckon an early bird ticket might be required from now on, as it was even busier than last year! I even missed out on the brie and crackers...

Again, my list of bands includes a couple of bands for whom we only saw the odd song:

<table class="noborder">

    <th>
      Saturday
    </th>

    <th>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      Metallica<br /> Pendulum<br /> Avenged Sevenfold<br /> Dropkick Murphys<br /> Plain White T's<br /> Alexisonfire<br /> Mindless Self Indulgence<br /> Eureka Machines
    </td>

    <td>
      Babyshambles<br /> Rage Against The Machine<br /> Vampire Weekend<br /> Goldfinger<br /> Friendly Fires<br /> Biffy Clyro<br /> Serj Tankian<br /> Dizzee Rascal<br /> Taking Back Sunday
    </td>

    <td>
      The Killers<br /> Bloc Party<br /> You Me At Six<br /> The Raconteurs<br /> Seasick Steve<br /> Hifi Handgrenades<br /> The Automatic<br /> Random Hand
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Again, I felt like I missed a load, but with so many on at the same time it's impossible to get it all in! Thanks go out to [Rob Marshall](http://rdmsoft.com/) for his [clash finder](http://bugs.rdmsoft.com/leeds/), which helped out greatly!
