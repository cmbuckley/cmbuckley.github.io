I'm still tired a full day after getting back, but I thought it was worth mentioning how good the festival was!

I didn't get a ticket immediately after [last year]({% post_url 2007-08-27-leeds-festival-2007 %}), but [waited until March]({% post_url 2008-03-31-leeds-festival-line-up %}). With hindsight, I reckon an early bird ticket might be required from now on, as it was even busier than last year! I even missed out on the brie and crackers...

Again, my list of bands includes a couple of bands for whom we only saw the odd song:

Friday                   | Saturday                 | Sunday
-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------
Metallica                | Babyshambles             | The Killers
Pendulum                 | Rage Against The Machine | Bloc Party
Avenged Sevenfold        | Vampire Weekend          | You Me At Six
Dropkick Murphys         | Goldfinger               | The Raconteurs
Plain White T's          | Friendly Fires           | Seasick Steve
Alexisonfire             | Biffy Clyro              | Hifi Handgrenades
Mindless Self Indulgence | Serj Tankian             | The Automatic
Eureka Machines          | Dizzee Rascal            | Random Hand
                         | Taking Back Sunday       |

Again, I felt like I missed a load, but with so many on at the same time it's impossible to get it all in! Thanks go out to [Rob Marshall](http://rdmsoft.com/) for his [clash finder](http://bugs.rdmsoft.com/leeds/), which helped out greatly!
