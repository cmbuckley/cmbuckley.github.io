I started this list at _D_ because this home desktop was the fourth computer I or my family owned, starting with the [Amstrad](/interests/computing/), and it seemed like they deserved a gap to be left for them!

Things got a little weird in the middle so I may have to go back and fill the gaps at some point, since I'm running out of letters...
