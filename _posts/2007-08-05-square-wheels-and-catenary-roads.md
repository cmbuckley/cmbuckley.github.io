The other day [Paul](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=150) told me that square wheels (and, indeed, any regular polygon except a triangle) can [ride on a road constructed of inverted catenaries](http://maa.org/mathland/mathtrek_04_05_04.html). A catenary is the curve made by a telegraph wire when stretched between two poles --- a cable hanging under its own weight.

A little bit of thinking about the road makes you realise that the length of the catenary _s_ must be the same as the length of the side of the square, and the height _h_ must be

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-240" src="/files/2007/08/catenary-formula.gif" alt="h = s(√2 − 1) / 2" width="109" height="35" />.

This is because the centre of the square, the axle, must remain at a constant height from the ground for a smooth ride.

Anyway, armed with this information, I spent this afternoon making a real-life version of this. I used some string to mark out a catenary of the right size, and used it as a template on two bits of plywood. A fair bit of jigsawing and filing later, I had this:

I was really surprised how well it worked! Check [the video](http://video.scholesmafia.co.uk/?id=22) to see how smoothly the "wheel" runs along the "road"!
