Today, we had the first [flash mob](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_mob) in Market Square. The mission: everyone had to freeze for two minutes when the cathedral bells rang 2pm.

I have mixed feelings about how well this worked: On one hand, it grabbed a number of people's attention, including (but not limited to) a kid behind me who I heard say, "Mam, everybody's stopped moving..." On the other hand, Market Square on a market day is often full of people standing around, and I half feel we didn't do it justice.

It was [captured on film](http://youtube.com/v/yBWDVLzbLIE), but unfortunately the scheduled cameraman somehow broke his camera before the event! My suggestion for the next flash mob was somewhere like outside the library, which has great opportunities for elevated filming. But hey! Still a good thing to be a part of --- and I even get in the video, albeit as everyone's walking off!
