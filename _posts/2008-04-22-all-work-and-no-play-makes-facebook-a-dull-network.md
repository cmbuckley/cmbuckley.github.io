The walls have spoken. In the last week or so, Facebook has introduced a new feature called [Lexicon](https://www.facebook.com/lexicon/) ([learn more](https://www.facebook.com/help.php?topic=lexicon)), which allows you to enter a number of search terms and see how popular those terms are on people's walls. The [graph](https://www.facebook.com/lexicon/index.php?q=party%20tonight,%20hangover) of "party tonight" when compared with "hangover" is quite predictable, especially around Hallowe'en and New Year's:

The [graph I found interesting](https://www.facebook.com/lexicon/index.php?q=work%2C+play), however, compared "work" and "play": it seems much more people are talking about the former! Or maybe it's just that they're complaining about it?

Or maybe it's because people who go out and have fun actually go do it rather than sitting on Facebook talking about it, whereas people at work just sit on Facebook and complain...
