After spending too much time looking at images on imagechan, I was reminded of a perfect photo opportunity from childhood, sitting just in my garage:

{% include figure.html url="/files/2008/02/happy_switch.jpg" img="/files/2008/02/happy_switch-300x225.jpg" alt="Light switch with crack in the shape of a smile" %}

Maybe I should be doing some work.
