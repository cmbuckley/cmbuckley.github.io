I finally managed to make the Berghaus Leap of Faith!

I tried it on Friday, and managed to touch the pocket, something I'd never thought possible until that moment! So today, I just went for it, and managed to keep hold before finishing the route.

As is the way with these things, the [video](/videos/climbing/) of the second attempt wasn't half as smooth as the first, but you can still get an idea. On that videos page is another pockets route that had evaded me since first year, and after that I was so pleased with myself that I decided to mess around on the I-bar!
