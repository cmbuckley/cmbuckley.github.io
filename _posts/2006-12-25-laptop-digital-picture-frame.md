Happy Christmas!

Now that Christmas has arrived, I can released this project onto the Media Network. I was waiting so that my parents wouldn't get a sneak preview of their present!

There is more information on the [project page](/projects/laptop/), but basically I converted an old laptop into a digital picture frame and gave it to my parents as a Christmas present. It connects to our network drive and shows all of my parent's pictures in a slide show. I'm quite happy with the finished product!
