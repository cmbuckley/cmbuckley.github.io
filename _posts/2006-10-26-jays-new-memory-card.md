[Jay](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31) managed to get a [Sony M2 memory card](http://sony.co.uk/view/ShowProduct.action?product=MSA1GA) delivered next-day after getting bored of waiting for a month for Orange to deliver. It's tiny!

The picture on their site gives no scale, so here's a shot of it next to my finger:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-271" src="/files/2006/10/m2-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" srcset="/files/2006/10/m2-300x179.jpg 300w, /files/2006/10/m2.jpg 488w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/files/2006/10/m2.jpg)

I have to say, I was rather impressed!

This weekend is Old Boys' Weekend at our college, so that means a load of people coming up, hopefully a few from last year, so we can catch up and see who's got a job and who's still sitting around looking...
