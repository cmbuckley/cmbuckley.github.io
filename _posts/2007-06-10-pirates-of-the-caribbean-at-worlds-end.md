Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate’s life for me…

[Helen](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=5), [Caroline](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=46) and I went to see the third film this evening. If you didn’t like either of the first two, don’t go see this one. Mind you, that’s because you’re a lost cause; they were both excellent, and this one was a great finish to the trilogy!

Convoluted? Difficult to follow? Pah. If you know the characters well enough, then the complexity only makes the film better. There’s not as much comedy in this as there was in the previous two, but it had its moments: from the recoil of Marty’s gun to Jack’s miniature pirate ship, this film is everything I could have wanted!

I want to be a pirate!
