So much stuff going on!

We had [Aimee](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=32)'s [birthday](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/05/25.05.07-aimee's-birthday/) last week, then I went down to [Norfolk](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/05/26.05.07_27.05.07-wells/) for my [Dad](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=37)'s birthday, and when I returned [Vinny](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=27) came up with his [bike](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/05/30.05.07-durham/), I managed to break mine, and we've been out for a number of [end-of-exam drinks](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/05/31.05.07_01.06.07-lloyds,love-shack/)! We had the end-of-term party at college, then there was poker, and yesterday was the annual [Bacchanalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchanalia) beer festival at college, then there's either [Caroline](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=46)'s house party tonight, or there's cheap entry at the [Grosvenor](http://grosvenorcasinos.com) in Newcastle tonight!

The only problem with so much going on is that I always have to feel so bad for missing so much stuff!
