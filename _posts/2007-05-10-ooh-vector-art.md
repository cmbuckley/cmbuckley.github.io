Today I [stumbled](http://stumbleupon.com) upon this vectorising tool, called [textorizer](http://textorizer.whatfettle.com/), that converts images into <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> format. You can specify your own text and size, as well as playing around with the edge-finding sensitivity.

Here's the result on the logo used on my <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feeds:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-259" src="/assets/posts/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_-300x41.png" alt="" width="300" height="41" srcset="/assets/posts/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_-300x41.png 300w, /assets/posts/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_-500x69.png 500w, /assets/posts/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/assets/posts/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_.png)

Obviously it works less well for full-depth images, but messing around with the threshold helps. Have fun!
