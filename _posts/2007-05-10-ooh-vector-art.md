Today I [stumbled](http://stumbleupon.com) upon this vectorising tool, called [textorizer](http://textorizer.whatfettle.com/), that converts images into <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> format. You can specify your own text and size, as well as playing around with the edge-finding sensitivity.

Here's the result on the logo used on my <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feeds:

{% include img.html url="/files/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_.png" img="/files/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_-300x41.png" alt="CMBuckley.co.uk logo" %}

Obviously it works less well for full-depth images, but messing around with the threshold helps. Have fun!
