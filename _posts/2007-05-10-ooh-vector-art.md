Today I stumbled upon this vectorising tool, called {% include archive.html text="textorizer" url="http://textorizer.whatfettle.com/" %}, that converts images into <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> format. You can specify your own text and size, as well as playing around with the edge-finding sensitivity.

Here's the result on the logo used on my <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feeds:

{% include figure.html url="/files/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_.png" img="/files/2007/05/rss_logo.svg_-300x41.png" alt="CMBuckley.co.uk logo" %}

Obviously it works less well for full-depth images, but messing around with the threshold helps. Have fun!
