<figure class="poem">We are all friends
No matter when
No matter where
No matter how dangerous the way
No matter how far the way that we are yearning towards.
But we all know
No matter where we are
We have our own companion now.
And we can get everywhere no matter how far it is.
Because we have our own bright future
As long as we still have dreams.</figure>
