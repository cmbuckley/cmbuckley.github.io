_We are all friends
  
No matter when
  
No matter where
  
No matter how dangerous the way
  
No matter how far the way that we are yearning towards.
  
But we all know
  
No matter where we are
  
We have our own companion now.
  
And we can get everywhere no matter how far it is.
  
Because we have our own bright future
  
As long as we still have dreams._
