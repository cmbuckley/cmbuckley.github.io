We are all friends  
No matter when  
No matter where  
No matter how dangerous the way  
No matter how far the way that we are yearning towards.  
But we all know  
No matter where we are  
We have our own companion now.  
And we can get everywhere no matter how far it is.  
Because we have our own bright future  
As long as we still have dreams.
