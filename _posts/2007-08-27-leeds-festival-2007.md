What can I say!

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. We stayed in the same place as the last few years, getting there early and still struggling to find space, since so many had gone in on early tickets (plan for next year?). [Olly](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=10) was coming after work, so the brie and crackers would have to wait!

This is who I managed to see during the weekend. Most I saw all the way through, but for some we only caught a couple of songs.

I missed a few that I wanted to see, including a secret appearance from the Kaiser Chiefs on Saturday, but I saw enough to make up for the misses!

And as for next year? I might as well get the ticket now!
