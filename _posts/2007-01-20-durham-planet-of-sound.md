[Andy](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=30) and [Jay](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31) finished their Engineering project yesterday. And [Lara](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=29) got her Physics project in. And I did half her Physics project. So we were all out to celebrate!

A few Bailey bars, we didn't even make it to Cuth's though --- finished at 24's with one of the most annoying train-station games... Thanks to Andy and Jay!

And then... six quid to get to get into Planet of Sound! _Six quid!_

Good night though! Must say there was a bit of cheating around the pool table, with a few too many distractions from [Aimee](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=32)...
