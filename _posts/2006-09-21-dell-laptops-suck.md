I hate Dell PCs. I just uninstalled the [Paint Shop Pro](https://www.paintshoppro.com/) trial from our laptop, and installed a working, full version. Having done that, the "Sonic Update Manager" decided that it was going to take over our machine, and pop up whenever we started the computer. It turns out that this lovely bit of software is part of the Dell package, and should any unsuspecting (yet sensible) person uninstall part of their software package, they are forced to deal with this tribulation. Five minutes was far too long for me to remove this software.

[Digital Spy](https://digitalspy.com) have a [relevant thread](https://forums.digitalspy.com/discussion/339666/error-message-im-at-my-wits-end) that might be of some use to those suffering from Shoddy Software Syndrome.

This just serves to reaffirm my hatred of Dell.
