Whilst browsing the old {% include archive.html url="http://www.invisibleshadow.com" text="Invisible Shadow network" %}, I was looking to see if any of the old stuff existed on there. One thing I remember was a section for code snippets, both Visual Basic and PHP. It seems that [Logan](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=33) has {% include archive.html text="started it up again" url="http://php.invisibleshadow.com/" %}. I always recommend that the best way to learn to program is to read others' code --- this kind of website helps with that.

It's a bit sparse at the moment, having just restarted, but once established these sites can become a useful resource for any level of programmer. Good work Logan!
