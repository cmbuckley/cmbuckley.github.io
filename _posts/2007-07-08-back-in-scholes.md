Well, that's it. I'm back for good. It feels very strange to think I won't be going back to Durham again! That's not entirely true; I'll be back for the start of next term to sort out the changeover of the <acronym title="Hild Bede Mountaineering Club">HBMC</acronym>, and then there'll be [Claire](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=166) and my graduation in January, but it won't be the same!

So much has been going on since I last posted --- in fact, that's why I haven't had chance to post. Since then, we've had the [Summer Ball](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/06/15.06.07_16.06.07-summer-ball/), which was a bit of a washout, but still managed to be a great laugh if only for the people there; there was a rather drunken [Going Down Formal](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/06/19.06.07_20.06.07-going-down-formal/) that ended up in Walkabout; also paintballing and, of course, the respective graduations.

It took me three car trips to get all my stuff back home. For those of you who couldn't believe I have that much stuff, remember that I took up a trailer in second year, and have since taken more and more stuff each time I've gone back. Take a look at the photo if you don't believe me!

Now that I'm back, it's time for the usual --- Angel? Check! Jinnah? Tonight!
