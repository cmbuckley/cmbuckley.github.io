I got back to Durham yesterday afternoon. I haven't unpacked anything, except my computer --- important things first!

Today I get to enjoy an induction meeting that lasts for 95 minutes, followed by going to pick up my registration papers. Maybe I'll also get to see my office today...

It's good to be back. Let's see what Walkabout's like tonight!
