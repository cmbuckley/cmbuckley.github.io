I have re-installed [Windows Live Messenger](http://get.live.com/messenger/overview) today, after attempting to get it working before and being a bit miffed. For one thing, the contact list seemed to have lost any control over showing display pictures as per MSN Messenger 7.5, and plugin control for [Messenger Plus! Live](http://msgpluslive.net) was handled rather differently.

The second time round went better, but I still had to use [A-Patch](http://apatch.org) to remove the adverts and make a few other tweaks. That done, I started messing around with some scripting and discovered I'd lost the knack for anything but PHP...

However, my mood improved greatly when I found the button I had been looking for (it had been there all along, this is what happens when we don't explore):
