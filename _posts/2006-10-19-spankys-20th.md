What a night!

I just got back from [Helen](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=5)'s birthday night out --- I was totally prepared to make a fool of myself due to the [Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_Disney_characters)-themed evening --- but I had an absolutely amazing night!

When she suggested a Disney bar crawl, I thought: "Easy: Why not?" It soon dawned on me that a Disney outfit is in fact rather difficult! While the ladies have it much easier, with their plethora of princesses (I'm not sure of the _exact_ collective noun), guys have to wade through the predictables to choose something interesting. Those who tried less hard turned up as extras from _[Cool Runnings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Runnings)_; I, on the other hand, made a distinct effort and came as [Bernard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_(The_Rescuers))! It took a bit of time and effort, but due to the response I received this evening, I could probably wear the exact same outfit (_sans_ whiskers) to be [Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario)...

A number of college bars were followed by the DSU, Jimmy Allens and Love Shack... Tonight was brilliant as far as I'm concerned, I just hope that Helen agrees tomorrow morning!
