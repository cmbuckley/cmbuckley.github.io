Whilst browsing the [Facebook Developers' Directory](https://developers.facebook.com/), I happened upon a product called Photomosaic (thankfully not guilty of [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase)). The product offered to create a mosaic of a profile picture using friends' profile pictures. Being rather frustrated to find that it didn't work, I set out to find a program to do it for me, and found [AndreaMosaic](https://andreaplanet.com/andreamosaic/) (who _are_ guilty of CamelCase).

This is the result, a mosaic of 3600 images from my [pictures collection](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/):

{% include figure.html url="/files/2006/09/mosaic.jpg" img="/files/2006/09/mosaic-300x225.jpg" caption="Mosaic of me and Mini Buckley" %}

Anyone who wants to down the [full-size image](https://cmbuckley.co.uk/graphics/mosaic.jpg) may do so, but be warned that it's over 25MB!
