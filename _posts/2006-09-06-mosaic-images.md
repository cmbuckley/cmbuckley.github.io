Whilst browsing the [Facebook Developers' Directory](http://developers.facebook.com/products.php), I happened upon a product called Photomosaic (thankfully not guilty of [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase)). The product offered to create a mosaic of a profile picture using friends' profile pictures. Being rather frustrated to find that it didn't work, I set out to find a program to do it for me, and found [AndreaMosaic](http://andreaplanet.com/andreamosaic/) (who _are_ guilty of CamelCase).

This is the result, a mosaic of 3600 images from my [pictures collection](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/):

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-275" src="/files/2006/09/mosaic-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="/files/2006/09/mosaic-300x225.jpg 300w, /files/2006/09/mosaic-400x300.jpg 400w, /files/2006/09/mosaic.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/files/2006/09/mosaic.jpg)

Anyone who wants to down the [full-size image](https://cmbuckley.co.uk/graphics/mosaic.jpg) may do so, but be warned that it's over 25MB!
