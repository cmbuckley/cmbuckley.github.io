This was my first time at [Victorious Festival](https://www.victoriousfestival.co.uk/) in Portsmouth, and after the past 18 months, it was great to get back to the festival crowds!

This was the first time I'd camped at a festival since Glastonbury in 2015, so now we're a bit older we didn't pack as lightly as I used to! The sack truck was the best remedy for that though!

The festival is set up on Southsea Common and was well organised, especially given the extra complications of COVID checks on entry. Also managed to avoid the worst of the bus queues back to the campsite!

Here's what I saw during the weekend:
