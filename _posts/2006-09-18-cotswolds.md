Hehe.

Have been back from the Cotswolds for a couple of days now. To be honest, IMHO once you've seen one market town you've seen them all, so I was surprised at how enjoyable the weekend was. I was _really_ surprised to find so many pubs with Wi-Fi access points!

On the one rainy day, we visited the [Cotswold Motor Museum](http://cotswold-motor-museum.com) in the picturesque village of Bourton-on-the-Water, the home of the wonderful [Brum](http://brum.tv).
