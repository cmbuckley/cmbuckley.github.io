I got back from Leeds Festival last night. I would have made a separate post about the Lake District trip, but I pretty much went straight to the festival after that!

The Lake District was mostly dry and warm, except for a bit of rain --- oh, and when I went swimming from the lakeside!

We found some quality watering holes in [Bowness-on-Windermere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowness-on-Windermere), including Churchill's and The Old John Peel Inn. Food and drink were as expensive as to be expected in them though!

We even managed to get in a bit of crazy golf on the second day, as well as a swim in the marina's indoor swimming pool. It was a lot warmer than the lake!

We got back and I went straight to [Tex](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=18)'s, and a rainy evening meant the scheduled barbecue was moved into the garage. Backed up the car for a bit of quality music!

And on to Leeds Festival. After a long walk in from the road to avoid the queues, we pitched up among everyone else and set about getting with the festival atmosphere with, erm, brie and crackers. Good idea [Olly](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=10)!

All in all we saw about thirty bands, I haven't yet worked out the exact number, but I'm working on finding all the set lists and putting together my virtual festival.

Both phone and camera batteries gave up the ghost early on in the weekend, so some of the pictures were taken on disposable cameras. We shall have to see how those come out.

A quality few days then!
