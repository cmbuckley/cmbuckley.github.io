We went to see _[Spider-Man 3](http://spiderman3.sonypictures.com/)_ for [Jay](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31)'s birthday today. I've seen the second, and really enjoyed it. This one, I must admit, was no different --- despite warnings from critics and friends alike that "there's too much going on."

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253" src="/files/2007/05/spider-man_flag-300x206.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" srcset="/files/2007/05/spider-man_flag-300x206.jpg 300w, /files/2007/05/spider-man_flag.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/files/2007/05/spider-man_flag.jpg) One thing, though --- I'm sure it's tongue-in-cheek, or at least I hope it is --- but I did find it rather daft that when ol' Spidey wins back the public, there's a huge American flag? I've read that the same thing was done in a more subtle way in the first film, and apparently so much more so in the second that I don't remember it. But was that necessary? Come on!

In addition, the symbiote seems to turn him in to [Gerard Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Way). Anyone else notice that? Oh, [apparently they did](http://community.livejournal.com/wtf_inc/4308191.html?thread=91078367#t91078367).
