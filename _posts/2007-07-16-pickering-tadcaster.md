I went on holiday this weekend to Pickering with my parents and [Geoff](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=186) and [Gwen](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=173). Okay, it's not that far away --- one might argue that it's not a holiday if the Coastliner goes past the camp site --- but we had a really great time, despite the rain on Friday!

While we were there, we went to the Dalby Forest to check out [Bridestones](https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/bridestones_north_yorkshire-1085), a small set of bouldering problems about 5 minutes' walk from the forest drive. We didn't even try to get Geoff on [Go Ape](https://goape.co.uk/locations/dalby), having failed at getting him to go on the jet boat out of Whitby harbour!

We got back yesterday, and in the evening I went over to the Angel. A large number failed to turn up for a number of reasons; shame on you! Congratulations to [Caitlin](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=7) for turning up for once! We had a rather feeble go at the quiz, and after the Angel shut we went over to the Queen --- the first time I'd been. Imagine a Wetherspoon's about as large as a living room and you'd be pretty close...
