Wednesday's climbing was interesting, to say the least...

[Jay](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31) managed to dislocate his knee after slipping on a challenging route. He didn't look very happy! Thankfully it relocated itself swiftly, but that did mean he missed out on the laughing gas the supervisor brought over! Painkillers and drink solved the problem once at home, and he is now hobbling at a mediocre pace.

On a personal note, I managed a few nice routes both on the roped section and on the bouldering wall. Hopefully my improvements indoors will map nicely to real rock!

Climbing again tomorrow, followed by Casino Royale --- can't wait for that!
