Lolcat has taken over my life. I spend far too long looking through pictures of amusing cats superimposed with intentionally grammatically incorrect captions.

But I love it.

Some of my favourites:

[![I'll fix it](/files/2007/06/1-100x100.jpg "I'll fix it")](/files/2007/06/1.jpg)
[![Can I plz has dis shiny device](/files/2007/06/2-100x100.jpg "Can I plz has dis shiny device")](/files/2007/06/2.jpg)
[![I has a money](/files/2007/06/3-100x100.jpg "I has a money")](/files/2007/06/3.jpg)
[![<lolcat align=right>](/files/2007/06/4-100x100.jpg)](/files/2007/06/4.jpg)
[![In ur quantum box... maybe](/files/2007/06/5-100x100.jpg "In ur quantum box... maybe")](/files/2007/06/5.jpg)

For more pictures, check [http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/](http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/) or [http://www.lolcats.com](http://www.lolcats.com), or perhaps you might want to check out [http://lolcode.org](http://lolcode.org), a programming language based on those exact macros. It's arguably as good as some of the [esoteric programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)!

So good, even [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) has [picked up on it](https://xkcd.com/262/).
