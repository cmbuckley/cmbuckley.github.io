So, Brown's is a posh place, eh?

[Chucky](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=50) would disagree! Here's me turning up in shirt and tie (alluding to the olden days) when I spy Chucky at the other side of the restaurant in a sweatshirt and jeans. He might as well be mocking my attire, but everyone knows that's simply not possible...

Browns is followed by many a drink at Revolution, before finding [Cat](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=161) and [Kat](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=13), and completing my night of meeting legends by complete surprise! Having apologised profusely to Cat because I thought I wouldn't see her before she jetted off to sunny Russia, I manage to pick her out in a crowd in Revolution!

And to finish the evening, the taxi driver completely failed to screw us over --- felt very happy about that!
