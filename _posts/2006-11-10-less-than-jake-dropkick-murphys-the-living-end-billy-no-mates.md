Awesome!

I was originally planning not to go, but when [Reg](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=88) popped round and said he had a spare ticket for Â£17.50, I thought: "why not?" At this time I had no idea who were supporting, so you can imagine how good it felt to find out that [The Living End](http://thelivingend.com.au/) and [Dropkick Murphys](http://dropkickmurphys.com/) were two of the warm-up acts!

Both were amazing, except TLE unfortunately didn't play their cover of "Tainted Love" --- ah well!

And then for [Less Than Jake](http://www.lessthanjake.com/)...

When they played at [Leeds Festival]({% post_url 2006-08-29-my-personal-festival %}), they played a lot of stuff from their then-forthcoming album _[In With The Out Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_with_the_Out_Crowd)_, which I didn't own. This time, however, they played mostly songs of a _[Losing Streak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Streak)_ / _[Hello Rockview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Rockview)_ era, which was brilliant!

Aside from the music, it was great to catch up with [Cait](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=7), who had been avoiding me, and [Joe](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=8), who travelled all the way up from Manchester. His long journey back meant that he got back around 6am and had a 9 o'clock lecture. Oh dear!
