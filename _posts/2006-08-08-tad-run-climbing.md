Yesterday saw the legendary Tad Run being completed in excellent style by a number of us. We started at the Falcon for a bit of lunch (the usual Brit doesn't do food on a Monday), and working an interesting route around to finish at the Angel in plenty of time. All in all, a very respectable Run, with minor closing hiccups being dealt with promptly!

Against all odds, [Booth](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=25) and I managed to get out climbing today, for a few introductory routes over at [Caley Crag](http://yorkshiregrit.com/caley.html). A good way to clear the head after a heavy day of drinking, and a good way to start climbing after a fairly long break!
