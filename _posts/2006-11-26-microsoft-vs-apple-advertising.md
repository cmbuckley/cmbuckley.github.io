With the launch of Windows Vista looming, Microsoft have released a [viral marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing) campaign featuring [Demetri Martin](https://demetrimartin.myshopify.com/), called [Clearification](https://www.istartedsomething.com/20061005/vista-viral-clearification/). The hiring of an American comedian to advertise their product was matched by Apple, who hired Demitri's [_The Daily Show_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show) co-correspondent John Hodgman --- alongside Justin Long --- for their ["Get a Mac" campaign](http://apple.com/getamac/ads/).

Both are really funny; I don't like Microsoft as a corporation, and I don't like the Mac OS, but I can cast these feelings aside for the comedy!
