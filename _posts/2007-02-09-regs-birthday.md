Last night (well, Wednesday night, it's 2am) was [Reg](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=88)'s birthday night out. We started up at Butler --- without Reg, I might add --- before moving along the hill and then down to [Varsity](http://varsitybars.com/bars/bar.aspx?guid=B363CACE-1DB2-4A9E-9E03-84CFC472A575) for a bit of drinking and table dancing ([Ste](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=126), [Jon](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=267)) and finally Love Shack. A select few had gone to the effort of making tank tops (beaters, if you will) with some excellent pictures of Reg and themselves... see [the pictures](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/02/07.02.07_08.02.07-reg's-birthday/) for examples!

I must say I was impressed with Ste and Jon's acoustic stuff in Mary's, as we'd been drinking for a couple of hours then, and I know that when I have even the odd drink my guitar-playing skills end up at sausage-finger level!
