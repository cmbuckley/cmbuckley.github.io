Last night we went over to [Newcastle University Union](http://unionsociety.co.uk/) to see [The Automatic](http://theautomatic.co.uk), supported by [Mumm-Ra](http://mumm-ra.com) and [Alterkicks](http://alterkicks.co.uk). Liverpool-based band Alterkicks played an indie-ish (but not retro, oh no not retro) set to begin with, followed by Sussex boys Mumm-Ra and their eclectic pop/alternative rock mix. Having missed them at [Leeds]({% post_url 2006-08-29-my-personal-festival %}) this year (due to sleeping in) I was glad to see them!

And finally to The Automatic, who did not disappoint with their blend of pop-punk, electronic and indie rock. If I ached from [yesterday]({% post_url 2006-10-12-first-climbing-session %}), then I don't know how to describe this morning! Apparently I'm getting old!

Back to Newcastle this evening for [Hannah](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=1)'s party --- in fact, must go make a CD...
