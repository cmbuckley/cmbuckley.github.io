Best couple of days ever...

[Nick](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=80) spotted return flights to Dublin from [Ryanair](http://ryanair.com) for 1p --- how could we miss out on that! [Andy](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=30), [Pete](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=167), Nick, [Jay](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31), [Mark](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=164) and I went over from Newcastle on Tuesday evening, stayed at [Isaac's](http://isaacs.ie) hostel for a night and spent two of the best nights out around Temple Bar! A night out over there is a little expensive, but for the transport and accommodation costs we couldn't complain!

The second morning, having vacated the hostel and dumped our bags at a 24-hour Internet caf√©, we went over to the [Guinness Storehouse](http://guinness-storehouse.com) --- the brewery and museum with the best view of Dublin, from their panoramic bar five floors up! And a free pint of Guinness included!

I'll need to steal Pete's pictures, though, as my camera battery failed on the plane over there...
