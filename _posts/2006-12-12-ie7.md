After downloading Internet Explorer 7 today, I have spent the morning sorting out a few CSS bugs across the Media Network. One thing I like is that the `:hover` pseudo-class is supported across all tags now, rather than just anchors; also `position: fixed` seems to have been sorted.

It's our house Christmas Day today: we're off out for a meal this year instead of cooking it ourselves, but there's presents to go at before that!
