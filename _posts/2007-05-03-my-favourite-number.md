I love the Internet. I love how countless code monkey hours are wasted trying to stop the inevitable. I love how people actually think it's possible to remove information from the Word Wide Web.

So back to my favourite number. Well, it's not prime, and it's not perfect, so it's not really my favourite number, and in fact the prime factors aren't really that interesting: 2<sup>6</sup> · 5 · 19 · 12043 · 216493 · 836256503069278983442067. It did make it onto [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), however, and it did crash [Digg](https://digg.com) for a full ten minutes. The reason? It's a lot more interesting when represented in hexadecimal:

09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0

Just thought I'd let you know.
