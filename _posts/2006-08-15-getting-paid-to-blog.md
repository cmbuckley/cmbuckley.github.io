I'm writing this from [Hayes](http://www.hayesgardenworld.co.uk) labelling machine. I have nothing better to do...

Yesterday, [Olly](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=10), [Helen](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=5) and myself went to [Xscape](http://www.xscape.co.uk) at Castleford with our two-hours-for-the-price-of-one tickets, only to find that students could get up to three hours for even less. Still, it was good to get the board back out of the cupboard and onto the snow. We still haven't sorted out the freeriding lessons yet, but hopefully we will when Reg returns. I can't wait for Val d'Is√®re now!

Have been much better on the bike since my last entry --- but as yet I haven't made it over the bollards at the old peoples' homes!

Pub tonight --- managed to sort it out for exactly the same day as the day I promised to fix my dad's boss' computer!
