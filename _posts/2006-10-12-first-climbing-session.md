Yesterday we took the new {% include archive.html url="https://www.dur.ac.uk/hildbede.mountaineeringclub/" text="HBMC" %} members to [Sunderland Wall](http://sunderlandwall.co.uk). It was a big turn-out, requiring four cars in total --- our biggest turn-out yet, I think!

Most of the new members thoroughly enjoyed the trip, and we found some exceptional climbers as well as many with great potential... Looks like we won't have to worry about handing the club over at the end of this year after all!

Tonight we're off over to Newcastle to see {% include archive.html url="http://www.theautomatic.co.uk" text="The Automatic" %} over at Newcastle University... Should be amazing!
