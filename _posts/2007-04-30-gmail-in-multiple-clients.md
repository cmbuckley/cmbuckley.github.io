Gmail has always confused me that when opening <acronym title="Post Office Protocol">POP</acronym> emails from multiple clients, only those opened in that client show up. In other words, if you open up an email using client <span class="maths">A</span>, you can't open it in client <span class="maths">B</span> --- you have to view it in webmail.

Of course, there's a workaround, provided in the [help centre](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=47948). The solution is to use your login as "`<strong>recent:</strong><em>username</em>@gmail.com`", rather than the usual "`<em>username</em>@gmail.com`". This is apparently automatic on mobile devices, but I don't see why it's not the default...
