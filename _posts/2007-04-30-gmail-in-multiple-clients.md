Gmail has always confused me that when opening <acronym title="Post Office Protocol">POP</acronym> emails from multiple clients, only those opened in that client show up. In other words, if you open up an email using client A, you can't open it in client B --- you have to view it in webmail.

Of course, there's a workaround, provided in the [help centre](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828). The solution is to use your login as `recent:username@gmail.com`, rather than the usual `username@gmail.com`. This is apparently automatic on mobile devices, but I don't see why it's not the default...
