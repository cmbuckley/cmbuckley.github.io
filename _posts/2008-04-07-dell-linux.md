I was never a big fan of Dell, mainly because it really annoyed me that they only shipped Windows with their machines. Reading [_The Microsoft File_](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-File-Secret-against-Gates/dp/0812927168) made it clearer, if no more acceptable; Microsoft bullied retailers to shipping tied processor--product bundles, effectively forcing other operating systems out of the market.

Dell redeemed themselves in my eyes when they [announced that they would be offering Linux as an alternative](http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/05/01/13147.aspx), but it seems that's not the [whole story](http://rudd-o.com/archives/2007/07/11/dell-paying-lip-service-only-to-linux/). To summarise the summary, it would appear that every time Dell offers some kind of alternative to Windows, there's always something that means the Windows users get preferential treatment over everyone else... Now that doesn't seem fair, does it?
