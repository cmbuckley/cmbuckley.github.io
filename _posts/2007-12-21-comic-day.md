At our last day at work before Christmas --- oh yeah, I got a job by the way --- we decided to have a go at some comics after seeing some [crazy](http://www.pandyland.net/20) [comics](http://www.pandyland.net/22) at [Pandyland](http://www.pandyland.net/23).

The rules? A maximum of 4 panels, and use some base imaging software. That's it! Here are the efforts:

{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/a-300x85.png" url="/files/2007/12/a.png" caption="Aubrey" %}
{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/b-300x293.png" url="/files/2007/12/b.png" caption="Bux" %}
{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/d-300x246.png" url="/files/2007/12/d.png" caption="Dave" %}
{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/j-300x78.png" url="/files/2007/12/j.png" caption="James" %}
{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/r-300x244.png" url="/files/2007/12/r.png" caption="Rich" %}
{% include figure.html img="/files/2007/12/s-300x250.png" url="/files/2007/12/s.png" caption="Sorrell" %}

Yes, I'm aware mine bears more than a little similarity to [Cyanide and Happiness](http://www.explosm.net/), but that's because I have very little imagination and graphics skills...
