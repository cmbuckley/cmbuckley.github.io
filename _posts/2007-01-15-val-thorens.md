I have just got back from my trip to Val Thorens with Collingwood College Skiing & Snowboarding Club. It was great! The snow was much better than Val d'Isère, at least for the first part of the week. The last couple of days weren't so good, but I missed out on the penultimate day so that was all right!

The reason that I missed out on a day was that we found an amazing closed red run that had the best powder --- and late on one day, when the light was low and flat, I hit an invisible kicker and flew unsuspecting to land on my coccyx on a rock. Ouch! I then had to crawl out of the bowl I'd just landed in...

Apart for one minor injury, the holiday was brilliant, the après-ski was great if a little expensive, and the accommodation was indeed very accommodating!
