It now seems that the server is back up and running rather well.

I still can't believe, after so many times, that I haven't learned to back up SQL tables! Still, nothing can be done... I'm just glad that the website itself wasn't lost!

Hopefully everything on the Scholes MAFIA and CMBuckley networks should slowly return to normal. The [Pictures site](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk) will be getting a major improvement from the admin side --- and users of [Facebook](http://facebook.com) (you procrastinators, you) should notice a few similarities too!

Right, bed time...
