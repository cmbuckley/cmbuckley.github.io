Woo, back in Scholes for Christmas!

And I'm already full... We had a Thai takeaway for tea when we got back --- my parents had just driven up from Norfolk this morning, and after taking three hours to get me back home, it was a lot easier! They always give us far too much, we even considered getting the set meal for two (it'd still be enough for the three of us).

After food came the next most important thing --- setting up the computer! Now my parents have the [laptop](http://blog.cmbuckley.co.uk/2006/09/21/dell-laptops-suck/), there's no need for a desktop upstairs, so I've just moved over the peripherals to my machine. The one exception was the screen --- there's no going back from TFT, I'm afraid!

So what's next? Looks like it's going to be a few drinks with some _bona fide_ Yorkshire folk!
