My _[Oblivion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483013/)_ DVD came with a digital download copy from UltraViolet. I headed over to the UltraViolet Web site to download it. My experience went something like this:

  * [The site](http://www.ultravioletuniversal.com/) looks like the result of a "my first ASP.NET Web page" tutorial.
  * I entered the code into the site and was redirected to Flixster.
  * One of the account options for Flixster is to "sign in with a Google account."
  * I'm then prompted to create a password for my new account. (So to what extent did I "sign in" with my Google account?)
  * The Flixster Web site is almost as bad (admittedly, ABP stops half of the site from functioning).
  * Flixster fails to register the import.
  * Typing in the code again gives an error --- it's already been used.
  * Support site says this happens a lot (might want to look in to that) and suggests logging out and back in again.
  * I can't log in with the new password I just created --- the details aren't recognised.
  * The "forgot password" link yields no e-mail, so now I have to sign in using the Google route.
  * Yep, the film is listed in my collection now.
  * "Please download Flixster Desktop to watch your movie."

Is it any wonder that people pirate films and TV? [Here's what xkcd have to say on the matter](https://xkcd.com/488/). The whole experience felt like [this infographic](http://lifehacker.com/5475113/remains-of-the-day-why-piracy-works-edition) --- and I haven't even started watching the film yet!
