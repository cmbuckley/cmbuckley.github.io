title: Enough Packaging?

After some trouble with our Belkin router recently, we managed to get it replaced under the lifetime warranty --- a very satisfying result! The router arrived today, and the packaging that brought it can only be described as overkill:

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-237" src="/files/2007/09/router-300x212.jpg" alt="Router and packaging" width="300" height="212" srcset="/files/2007/09/router-300x212.jpg 300w, /files/2007/09/router-423x300.jpg 423w, /files/2007/09/router.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/files/2007/09/router.jpg)

I'm all for my package arriving in good condition, and this extra padding certainly facilitates that, but was all that necessary? Oh well, it works!
