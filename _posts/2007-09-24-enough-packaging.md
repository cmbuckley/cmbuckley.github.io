After some trouble with our Belkin router recently, we managed to get it replaced under the lifetime warranty --- a very satisfying result! The router arrived today, and the packaging that brought it can only be described as overkill:

{% include figure.html url="/files/2007/09/router.jpg" img="/files/2007/09/router-300x212.jpg" alt="Router and packaging" %}

I'm all for my package arriving in good condition, and this extra padding certainly facilitates that, but was all that necessary? Oh well, it works!
