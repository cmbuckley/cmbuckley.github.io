I have just installed and started playing with [Firefox 2.0](http://mozilla.com/firefox/). I'm afraid to say that the first thing I did is install the [Winestripe](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3479/) theme, which is essentially the FF1.5 default theme --- I wasn't impressed with the 2.0 default!

Looks aside, the rest of the changes seem about right --- they finally got round to including a search engine manager as standard, and the previewing of web feeds works rather nicely --- though I did just finish writing the XSL for my [news feed](http://cmbuckley.co.uk/news/)! Bah...

Hopefully we can go climbing outside tomorrow, though I'm not sure we have enough kit. The shoes alone might be an issue...
