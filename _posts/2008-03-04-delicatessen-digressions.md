It was late on in the morning (ooh, at least 11). The conversation had wandered. It's taken me a few minutes sitting here to try and piece together the conversation again, but I think we started talking about Dave's _foot noir_ (his ingenious idea at James' leaving do) where he kicks a football around a fog-drenched pitch, lamenting James' absence. We then tried to think of a suitable score for the film, and I came up with Yann Tiersen's "Comptine d'un autre été: L'après-midi", an apt lament. I'd only seen it in [Aidan Gibbons](https://www.aidangibbons.com/)' [The Piano](https://www.aidangibbons.com/piano.html) ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr64NI33qUo)), but apparently it's from the [_Amélie_ soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amélie_(soundtrack)). So from _Amélie_, via [Jean-Pierre Jeunet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Jeunet), we get to _[Delicatessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicatessen_(film))_. A vision of dystopian France meant I just had to bring up _[District 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_13)_, then parkour and [_Casino Royale_]({% post_url 2006-11-26-casino-royale-planet-of-sound %}), but I digress.

Anyway, Emma lent me _Delicatessen_, and I watched it this evening. So many little things caught my eye that I couldn't turn away for one moment! For those who haven't seen it, I won't say much, but suffice it to say that an underground gang of vegetarian rebels is an interesting film concept...

Oh, and I know that this post is around 75% digression, but I must add that for some reason [Dominique Pinon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Pinon) reminds me of a certain [misunderstood](http://www.milienzo.com/2007/07/10/epuron-advert-will-make-you-smile/) [individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw_n_02-gN4)...
