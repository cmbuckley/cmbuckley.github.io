It's good to be back up here. When I got back we went for a drink at Wetherspoons, where [Reg](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=88) showed off his new back piercings --- and [Lara](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=29) managed to slap them as she left! Then Monday night: the first day of term, Collingwood's fund raiser at Walkabout, and St George's Day --- so many reasons to have a few (many) drinks! And tonight, some live metal/harcore music at Bar19, thanks to [Helen](http://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=5) and Chris! All in all, a great few days.
