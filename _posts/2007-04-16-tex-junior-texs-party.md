The weather was just right for the party (mainly for [Rob](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=19)'s 18th, but not far from [Tex](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=18)'s 21st). A couple of 9-gallon kegs from [Wold Top Brewery](http://woldtopbrewery.co.uk) and a hi-fi up on the banking topped off the afternoon! A game of killer table-tennis gave me my (apparently) inevitable injury as some of the garage clutter collapsed while running round...

A few more beers and it was time for the Grand National. Pretty much everyone had money on it in some form or other, even if it was only the sweepstake organised at the party. Tex's mum came off best, placing a tenner on the 34--1 winner Silver Birch --- I ended up with somewhat less...

It later cooled down enough for a few games of five-a-side out back, and then back in for me to show how awful I become at pool after a few drinks!

See [the pictures](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/2007/04/14.04.07-tex's-party/) for more of an idea.
