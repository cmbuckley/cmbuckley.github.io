Last night we had a go at the quiz down at the Barleycorn in Scholes. I remember the days when we used to be glad to scrape half the score of the winners --- this time a fairly impressive 28 put us considerably closer to the winning 35 (remember this is a pub where our group at least halved the average age). Not long now, soon we'll be regular winners...

Bad back today. Was absolutely useless out on the bike, and gave in for the evening to regroup tomorrow and hopefully do something worthwile!
