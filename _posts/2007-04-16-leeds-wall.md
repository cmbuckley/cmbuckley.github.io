The weather was more suited for getting out to a crag somewhere, but since we couldn't manage that we decided to visit [the Leeds Wall](https://www.theclimbingdepot.co.uk/) --- and since it was such a nice day, it was quite quiet!

[Jay](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=31), [Lara](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=29), [Georgina](https://pictures.scholesmafia.co.uk/index.php/?profile=344) and myself spent a full day at the wall, using some of the existing top-ropes but running the HBMC club rope when required. Jay had to prove himself as a competent belayer before being allowed to join!

We ran a number of tricky routes as well as some of the all holds routes --- Lara and Georgina proving themselves exceptionally good at climbing! Feel like I need to get some more practice in now!

I now can't work out if I ache from climbing or [football yesterday]({% post_url 2007-04-16-tex-junior-texs-party %})!
