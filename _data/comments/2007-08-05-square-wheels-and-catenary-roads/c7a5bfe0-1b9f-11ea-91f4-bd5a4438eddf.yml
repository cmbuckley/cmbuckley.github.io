comment: "Good Day \r\n \r\nHere at <a href=\"https://www.realmoney.ca\">party casino</a>, the top question our Canada-based online evaluation team gets asked more than any other  is almost certainly: “What is the best online casino site for Canadians?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we put together a list of websites according to their features – many specific to the experience of Canadians – and make sure it’s constantly up to date. These include things such as options for totally free customer care numbers, substantial welcome bonuses, totally free slots spins, radid payouts and Canada-friendly banking choices. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, we  also look at promos, jackpots and the choice of apps on the top online casinos to make sure you have the most enjoyable time. \r\n \r\nTo ring-fence your security and enjoyment, we keep a blacklist of gaming sites that fail to comply with our exacting guidelines. Casinos that fall short of the tests for security, software quality, user-support, finance and reliability find themselves on our blacklist. There are even some household names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/jackpot-win.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just three of the worst offenders from our ”avoid list” which we urge you to give a miss. \r\n \r\nFrom British Columbia to Newfoundland, we all know Canada is the best country on earth. But it’s also one of the leading places to live if you’re a gambling enthusiast, and not just because of the great range of quality online gaming sites – each with its own unique selection of games providing to its people. \r\n \r\nMany of these, like slots, on-line poker and blackjack have even developed their own individual following as well as communities of  Canadian players fans that like to play and discuss the game online. \r\n \r\nIt should be no surprise that Canadians also love betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as Worldwide tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother favourite target forinternet-gamblers is playing the official state-run online lotteries! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you own experience of online-gaming sites? We’re anxious to get your opinion so we can improve our selection criteria. For further info just follow the link above."
