comment: "Good Day \r\n \r\nAt <a href=\"https://www.realmoney.ca\">spin casino canada</a>, the one thing our Halifax-based online reviewers get asked more than any other  is: “What is the best on-line casino site for gamers in Canada?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we put together a list of websites according to their features – some of them specific to Canadians – and keep it constantly up to date. These include factors such as options for cost-free customer assistance numbers, enticing welcome bonuses, free-of-charge slots spins, fast payouts and Canada-specific banking arrangements. \r\n \r\nAdded to that, we also examine promos, top prizes and the selection of games on the leading internet casinos to make sure you get the most memorable time. \r\n \r\nTo ensure your security and enjoyment, we keep a blacklist of gaming sites that fail to comply with our strict guidelines. Casinos which fall short of our rules for confidentiality, software quality, customer-care, finance and reliability will end up on our blacklist. There are even some well-known names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/real-money-casino.jpg?x76036\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just a few of the worst examples from our ”worst of the worst” which we recommend you should give a miss. \r\n \r\nFrom Winsor to Vancouver, everyone knows Canada is the best country on earth. But it’s also among the top places to reside if you’re a gamer, and not just because of our country’s plentiful choice of quality online casinos – each with their own unique selection of games catering to its people. \r\n \r\nMany of these, such as slots, online poker and blackjack have even created their own personal following along with communities of Canadian-based enthusiasts that like to play and discuss the game online. \r\n \r\nIt should be no surprise that Canadians also adore betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as international tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother favourite target forinternet-gamblers is playing the official state-run online lotteries! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you own experience of internet-gambling sites? We’re happy to hear from you to allow us to improve our selection criteria. For in-depth information just follow the link above."
