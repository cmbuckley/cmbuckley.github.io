comment: "Hey there \r\n \r\nAt <a href=\"https://www.realmoney.ca\">free spins canada</a>, the top question our Halifax-based online review team gets asked most of all  is almost certainly: “What is the best internet casino site for Canadian gamers?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we put together a list of gaming sites ranked by their features – some of them specific to the Canadian experience – and keep it constantly updated. These include things such as the availability of free support numbers, tasty welcome bonuses, free slots spins, speedy payouts and Canada-specific banking solutions. \r\n \r\nIn addition, we also look at promos, jackpots and the line-up of apps on the top gaming sites to ensure you receive the best experience. \r\n \r\nTo ensure your security and fun, we keep a blacklist of casinos that do not measure up to our tough conditions. Sites which fail the tests for confidentiality, software quality, user-support, banking and reliability find themselves on our blacklist. There are even some famous names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/Rainbow-Riches.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, these are just a few of the worst examples from our ”list of death” which we recommend you should not visit under any circumstances. \r\n \r\nFrom British Columbia to Newfoundland, everyone knows Canada is the world’s number one nation. But it’s also one of the top places to live if you’re a online gamer, and not just because of our country’s plentiful choice of quality online gaming sites – each with their own unrivalled range of games catering to its people. \r\n \r\nA lot of these, such as slots, internet poker and blackjack have even attracted their own personal following and communities of Canadian focussed fans that like to play and discuss the game online. \r\n \r\nIt’s probably no shock that Canadians also adore betting on sports, especially the NHL, and anything hockey related such as Worldwide tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother popular target foronline-gamers is playing the official state-run online lotteries! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you own experience of online-gaming sites? We’re happy to get your opinion so we can improve our selection criteria. For further info just click the link above."
