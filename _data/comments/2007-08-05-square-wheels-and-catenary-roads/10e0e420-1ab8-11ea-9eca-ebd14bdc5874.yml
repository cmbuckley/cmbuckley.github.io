comment: "Hey there \r\n \r\nHere at <a href=\"https://www.realmoney.ca\">real money slot machines</a>, the top thing our Halifax-based online quality team gets asked most  is almost certainly: “What’s the best internet casino site for Canadians?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we regularly compile a list of websites according to their features – especially those specific to Canada – and keep it constantly refreshed. These include things like options for zero cost customer care numbers, big welcome bonuses, free-of-charge slots spins, fast payouts and Canada-friendly banking choices. \r\n \r\nOn top of that, we also examine specials, jackpots and the range of apps on the top on-line casinos to ensure you enjoy the most satisfying time. \r\n \r\nTo guarantee your safety and enjoyment, we keep a blacklist of casinos that do not comply with our exacting standards. Casinos which fail the tests for security, software quality, customer-care, banking and reliability find themselves on our blacklist. There are even some famous names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/Rainbow-Riches.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, these are just some of the worst offenders from our ”worst of the worst” which we urge you to not visit under any circumstances. \r\n \r\nFrom Alberta to Yukon, we all know Canada is the world’s number one nation. But it’s also one of the top places to live if you’re a gambling enthusiast, and not just because of our country’s plentiful choice of quality online gaming sites – each with its own unique selection of apps providing to its people. \r\n \r\nMany of these, like slots, on-line poker and blackjack have even attracted a dedicated following and communities of Canadian-based enthusiasts that like to play and talk about it together online. \r\n \r\nIt should be no surprise that Canadians also love betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as Intercontinental tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother popular target foronline-gamblers is playing the official state-run online lottery games! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you personal experience of internet-gambling websites?
