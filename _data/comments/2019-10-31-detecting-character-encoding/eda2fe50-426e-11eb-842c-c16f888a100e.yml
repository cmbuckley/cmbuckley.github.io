comment: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to lash to haughtiness learning. cheap essay writing service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis work</a> custom writing service order custom essay term paper. \r\nBut what is happening now can be named an emergency delivery of content to audience members in self-isolation . Most of schools  and the professors themselves were not prepared for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University teachers with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never used remote video services get  in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its modern methods are the main function of universities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it is funny. Colleagues from regional varsities said that some professors asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for verification.Now, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to new digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education professor asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more creative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports in self-isolation, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct classes on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, some of them only sends questions to WhatsApp. Some teachers record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is insufficient, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis statement for research papers</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
