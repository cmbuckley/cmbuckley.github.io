comment: "Good Day \r\n \r\nHere at <a href=\"https://www.realmoney.ca\">bingo online casino</a>, the top thing our Calgary-based online scrutineers get asked more than any other  is almost certainly: “What is the best on-line casino for Canadian gamblers?” \r\n \r\nAs part of our researches, we regularly compile a list of sites dependent on their features – especially those specific to Canada – and make sure it’s constantly updated. These include items such as options for toll-free contact numbers, enticing welcome bonuses, no cost slots spins, no-strings payouts and Canada-specific banking choices. \r\n \r\nAdditionally, we  also check on promos, top prizes and the choice of plays on the top gaming sites to make sure you enjoy an enjoyable time. \r\n \r\nTo ring-fence your safety and enjoyment, we keep a blacklist of casinos that do not measure up to our exacting selection standards. Casinos which fail the tests for confidentiality, software quality, customer-engagement, banking and reliability will end up on our “naughty list”. There are even some household names on there too. \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.realmoney.ca> <img src=\"https://www.realmoney.ca/images/jackpot-win.jpg\"> </a> \r\n \r\n \r\nFor example, here are just a few of the nastiest sites from our “list of shame” which we recommend you should visit at your peril. \r\n \r\nFrom Alberta to Yukon, we all know Canada is the world’s number one nation. But it’s also among the leading places to reside if you’re a gaming fan, and not just because of the great range of quality online gaming sites – each with their own unrivalled selection of games providing to its people. \r\n \r\nA lot of these, including slots, on-line poker and blackjack have even attracted a linked following along with communities of Canadian-based devotees that like to play and talk about it together online. \r\n \r\nIt’s probably no surprise that Canadians also love betting on sports, especially the NHL, and everything hockey related such as Worldwide tournaments, and the CFL. \r\n \r\nAnother popular target foronline-gamers is playing the official state-run online lottery games! \r\n \r\nWhat’s you own experience of online-gaming sites? We’re anxious to hear from you to allow us to fine tune our selection criteria. For further info just follow the link above."
