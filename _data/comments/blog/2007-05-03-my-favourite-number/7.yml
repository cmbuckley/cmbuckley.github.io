  That's so amazing! Sometimes when I'm bored I like to play a game: I tell my friends that I am thinking of a number between 1 and 13256278887989457651018865901401704641. No one ever guessed it until now, and now lot's of people are getting it right. Ain't that something?

  (LEGAL NOTICE: I am invested with the legal authority to extract financial and civil penalties from people playing this game or guessing this number without paying me my proper dues as inventore and promotor. I shall be suing the AACS forthwith.)
