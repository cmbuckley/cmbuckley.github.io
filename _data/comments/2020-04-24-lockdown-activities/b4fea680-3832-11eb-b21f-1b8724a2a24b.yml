comment: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to lash to interval learning. great essay writing service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>goodthesisstatementsdsa</a> work ethic essay for civil service. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an crisis delivery of content to listeners in self-isolation . A lot of schools  and the professors themselves were not ready for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut educators are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of schools. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Thus, the resourcefulness with which professors adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nIn some cases it is funny. Colleagues from regional universities said that some professors asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for according.In present, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten lectures and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. Although remote physical education training can be more unique, for example, you can do selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the popular domain, and teach them to play sports online, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct lectures on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, someone only sends questions to WhatsApp. Some educators record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some professors ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>art thesis</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
