In Easter of 2002, our sixth form was given an opportunity to go to Tignes, a Winter resort near Val d'Is√®re, for a week. Having already being skiing with the school to Cormayeur, Italy, I knew I liked skiing. However, I was offered the chance to go snowboarding, and it appealed to me very much. It was an amazing trip, and I really loved snowboarding. As well as being more physically challenging, it was simply a lot more fun. I felt a lot more relaxed on a board, more in control, and that meant I attempt more adventurous routes and tricks.

I joined the same trip the following year, but decided to become a little more involved in the sport, purchasing my own boots and clothing, but still using a rental board. This year, I was given the opportunity to ride with the more competent boarders. We ran some very challenging routes, managed a lot of off-piste boarding, and even got ourselves to the jump park for a day or two.

The following October, [Xscape](https://xscape.co.uk/) opened another retail centre in Castleford, complete with real ski slope! The run is short but provides enough interest for boarders, and occasionally has jumps open. A few of us took it upon ourselves to go along during the Christmas holidays of my first year of university.

By my third year, I had joined the university snowboarding club. I decided to purchase my own board and bindings too. I used this board for five seasons between 2006 and 2011 (missing only 2009). It survived incredibly well, only requiring a small service each season.

I spent 3 weeks in July 2012 in New Zealand, so I decided to purchase a new board, bindings and boots for the occasion, as well as the obligatory new gear. I managed to get away each year between 2014 and 2017, making good use of the snow train to travel to the French Alps --- it means an extra day or two on the slopes compared to flying! I was also able to go to Snowbombing in 2015, but I'm glad we went to Les Arcs eariler in the year because I really didn't get much boarding done...

For various reasons I've been on a bit of a hiatus since 2017, but I'm looking forward to being able to get back on the board again!
