I have worked closely with computers since I was very young. My first computer was an Amstrad CPC 6128 (right), with such games as _Arkanoid_, _Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing_, _Chuckie Egg_, _Dizzy_ and _Michael Jackson&#8217;s Moonwalker_ among others.

The Amstrad was also my first experience of programming, as _Amstrad Computer User_ always contained program listings for various games and logic puzzles. It was mostly just reading from the magazine itself, but it gave me an interest in programming that has stayed with me. Programming in the original BASIC also meant that I could learn by adapting the program listings to make the games more or less challanging.
