title: Jumsoft Money: Changes I'd Love to See
---

Features:

* Ability to categorise transfers (to improve use of "spending by category" report)
* Combined pie charts on "income & spending" reports
* Ability to mark accounts as closed
* Config to show transaction amounts in the currency of the transaction, instead of the account's default currency
* Ability to create loan accounts without having to configure scheduled payments (or recognise imported transactions as loan payments)
* Ability to tie a transaction to one address of a multi-address payee
* Custom account icons

App Bugfixes:

* Net worth summary is hidden when on a phone call
* Payees whose company names are updated don't update in the list; they show the correct name on the payee detail but the list name isn't updated unless you edit the payee on the device
* Support incrementing amounts by pence without needing to type the leading 0 before the decimal point - so "+ . 1" adds 0.10
