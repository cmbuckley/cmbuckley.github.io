Saturday - Lift wooden beams, cut down tree. Discuss plans for patio, flags, gravel etc.

Sunday - Lift concrete posts. Hailstones. Saw wood to size. Plan activity for rest of week.

Monday - Trip to Jewson / MKM to look at options for flags. Back home for last measuring and choosing flags, then back to MKM to order flags & gravel. Should arrive Thursday. Order skip. Take wood to tip. Put back out. Climbing didn't help.

Tuesday - Skip arrived 10am. Back still agony. Grass ordered for Thursday. Lifted most of the gravel, kept in tonne bag for reuse. Lifted table flags, kept sand. Initial back pain abating but being replaced by dull ache from digging. Dad over to help with tree root. Came out immediately. Bagged up a bit more stuff ready for tip tomorrow and lifted most of the flags by the shed.

Wednesday - Back better.Â Start work on removing turf 10am. Vincent over 10.30. 2/3 done by lunch (1.30). Conifer and bags to tip - Tad closed. Fish & Chips closed. Trip to Strensall tip - not allowed with Warrior. Wetherby Whaler on return. Back 3pm. Finished lifting turf 5pm, trip to Seacroft with conifer & bags. Evening - bagged up last few bits of gravel.

Thursday - Turf arrived 10am. Started on turning over topsoil and last of flags by shed. John over to help 10.30. Flags to Maguire, helped with digging too. Found live .44 round in soil - police called to dispose of. Break for lunch. Police arrived for bullet. More turning over. Bit of rain. Trip to B&Q for fertiliser & lawn edger. Rain worse on return, too muddy to continue. Rain largely stopped after 6pm, but still too wet to finish. Stop for tea and to dry out.
