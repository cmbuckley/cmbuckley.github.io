I'm Chris Buckley, a Leeds-born software enthusiast currently living in {{ site.details.location }}. I've been [interested in computers](/interests/computing/) ever since I can remember, and it was this and an obsession with all things mathematical that led me to study both at the [University of Durham](https://www.dur.ac.uk/) between 2003 and 2009. I work for {{ site.details.company }} as a {{ site.details.role }}.

As well as computers and programming, I enjoy [rock climbing](/interests/climbing/), [snowboarding](/interests/snowboarding/) and live music, and when I'm not working or doing one of those things you can usually find me in one of Leeds or York's many pubs and bars.
